+ Website design was made for minimalism(no distracting UI)
+ Completely tab-able buttons/forms
+ Instant responses form pending trips-and the cost
+ Accessibility Scores at 100



### Reflections

This was a difficult project to undertake for several reasons:

+ First and foremost I wanted a user interface that was bare but also appealing.
+ I didn't want to overcomplicate the experience and make users search for buttons.
+ I wanted precision but also dynamic code, and the functionality to be instant when a user makes choices.
+ I also wanted a product that wouldn't be overwhelming for people with disabilities. (tabbing)


### Future Features

+ Complete Redesign of the UI/UX:
  - Knowing what I know now, it'd be easier to redesign this product to fit the requirements I wanted and look less chunky.
  - A more streamline experience.
  - Less bubblegum pop UI/More professional.
  - A more appealing glassmorphism.

+ Remake with the intention of mobile first:
  - This product only is only appealing to the eyes on a very specific screen size.
  - Needs to be dynamic for a variety of devices.
  - Buttons would need to be changed with Icons that are appropriate for mobile.

+ Clean Up CSS:
  - CSS reuses a lot of the same values, and I could have easily cut this down by using proper methods.
  - It would also help to use variables as a means to make it more readable.

+ Clean up JS:
  - Despite having 100 Accessibility code processing is at a 86
  - Needs more dynamic functions/cascading functions(les global variables)

+ Testing:
  - Make tests range for more sad paths.

+ Agent Class:
  - At the moment there is no way to pass pending to approved. Would need to create an agent class to handle this feature.
